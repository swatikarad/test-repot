<p>Compared with the complex Indian mehandi designs, Arabic designs are much simpler. Arabic designs mostly consist of leaves, veins, flowers etc. These designs are perfect candidate if you want to extend the design from hand to arm or from foot to leg.
Another distinguishing feature of Arabic designs is that the shapes are not filled, they are just outlines. These designs also partially cover your hands or feet. These designs consume less amount of mehandi and are easily dried which means that you do not have to wait!
